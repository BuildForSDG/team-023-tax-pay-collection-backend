## About

What is this project about. Ok to enrich here or the section above it with an image.

Once this repo has been setup on Codacy by the TTL, replace the above badge with the actual one from the Codacy dashboard, and add the code coverage badge as well. This is mandatory

This is a simple JavaScript starter repo template for setting up your project. The setup contains

-   Jest: For runnung tests. We strongly recommend that JavaScript projects use Jest

-   Eslint & Prettier: For formatting code to match ESlint AirBnB coding standard. You might need to install the ESlint and Prettier plugins for your code editor to make the most of these utilities

## Why

Talk about what problem this solves, what SDG(s) and SGD targets it addresses and why these are imoirtant

## Usage

How would someone use what you have built, include URLs to the deployed app, service e.t.c when you have it setup

## Setup

Install `yarn` or `yarn` if you dont have any of them already installed. We recommend Yarn though.

After clonning the repo to your local machine and moving into the cloned folder, Run `yarn install` to get started by installing dependencies.

`src/index.js` is the entry to the project and source code should go into the `src` folder.

All tests should be written in the \`**tests**' folder. There's a sample in there.

This starter uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) as the bundler. It is much simpler that WebPack and the others

#### Hints

-   Run `yarn install` or `yarn install` to get started. We'll assume you are using Yarn.
-   Install additional dependencies: `yarn add <dependency-name> [-D]`
-   Run tests: `yarn test`
-   Run tests with test coverage info: `yarn test:cover`
-   Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: `yarn lint`
-   Run your app in local dev mode: `yarn start`. This puts the bundled app in a `dist` folder, set up a local web server at localhost:1234, and continues to watch for your code changes which it syncs with the local server. This means if you loaded the app in a browser, it will auto-refresh as you code along. Feel free to use whatever bundler best meets your needs. Parcel was only added as a sample and for those looking for a simple but effective solution to the hassle of bundlers.

## Authors

List the team behind this project. Their names linked to their Github, LinkedIn, or Twitter accounts should siffice. Ok to signify the role they play in the project, including the TTL and mentor

## Contributing

If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to [buildforsdg@andela.com](mailto:buildforsdg@andela.com) to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :

1.  area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)

-   MongoDB **4.0+**
-   Redis **5.0+**

### Login credentials

email: `admin@admin.com`  
password: `12345`

## How to install

### Using Git (recommended)

1.  Clone the project from github. Change "myproject" to your project name.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BuildForSDG/team-023-tax-pay-collection-backend.git ./TaxApp
```

### Using manual download ZIP

1.  Download repository
2.  Uncompress to your desired directory

### Install yarn dependencies after installing (Git or manual download)

```bash
cd TaxApp
yarn install
yarn update latest
```

### Setting up environments (development or production)

1.  In the root this repository you will find a file named `.env.example`
2.  Create a new file by copying and pasting the file and then renaming it to just `.env`
3.  The file `.env` is already ignored, so you never commit your credentials.
4.  Change the values of the file to your environment (development or production)
5.  Upload the `.env` to your environment server(development or production)
6.  If you use the postman collection to try the endpoints, change value of the variable `server` on your environment to the url of your server, for development mode use <http://localhost:3000>

**IMPORTANT:** By default token expires in 3 days (4320 minutes set in .env.example). You can refresh token at endpoint GET /token. If everything it´s ok you will get a new token.

### Mailer

To ensure the deliverability of emails sent by this API, `Mailgun` is used for mailing users when they sign up, so if you want to use that feature go sign up at their website <https://www.mailgun.com>

If you want to try a different method it´s ok, I used <https://nodemailer.com> for this API and they have different transport methods like: smtp.

### i18n

Language is automatically detected from `Accept-Language` header on the request. So either you send locale manually on the request or your browser will send its default, if `Accept-Language` header is not sent then it will use `en` locale as default.

## How to run

### Database cleaning and seeding samples

There are 3 available commands for this: `fresh`, `clean` and `seed`.

```bash
yarn run command
```

-   `fresh` cleans and then seeds the database with dynamic data.
-   `clean` cleans the database.
-   `seed` seeds the database with dynamic data.

### Running in development mode (lifting API server)

```bash
yarn run dev
```

You will know server is running by checking the output of the command `yarn run dev`

```bash
****************************
*    Starting Server
*    Port: 3000
*    NODE_ENV: development
*    Database: MongoDB
*    DB Connection: OK
****************************
```

### Running tests

It´s a good practice to do tests at your code, so a sample of how to do that in `mocha/chai` is also included in the `/test` directory

```bash
yarn run test
```

### Formatting code

Format your code with prettier by typing:

```bash
yarn run format
```

### Formatting markdown files

Format all your markdown files with remark by typing:

```bash
yarn run remark
```

### Linting code

Lint your code with ESLint by typing:

```bash
yarn run lint
```

## Usage

Once everything is set up to test API routes either use Postman or any other api testing application. Default username/password combination for login is `admin@admin.com/12345`.

### API documentation

### Postman API example collection

You can import the example collection to Postman. To import, click the import button located and select `postman-example.json` located within the root directory.

Go to `manage environments` to create environments for development, production, etc. On each of the environments you create you will need to:

1.  Create a new key `authToken` and within the `/login` request this value is automatically updated after a successfull login through a script located in the `tests` tab. Each time you make a request to the API it will send `Authorization` header with the `token` value in the request, you can check this on the headers of users or cities endpoints in the Postman example.

2.  Create a second key `server` with the url of your server, for development mode use <http://localhost:3000>

This is a REST API, so it works using the following HTTP methods:

-   GET (Read): Gets a list of items, or a single item
-   POST (Create): Creates an item
-   PATCH (Update): Updates an item
-   DELETE: Deletes an item

### Creating new models

If you need to add more models to the project just create a new file in `/app/models/` and it will be loaded dynamically.

### Creating new routes

If you need to add more routes to the project just create a new file in `/app/routes/` and it will be loaded dynamically or you can add them manually.

### Creating new controllers

When you create a new controller file, try to also create another file with validations. Ex. `featureController.js` and `featureController.validate.js`. An example of this is included in the repository.
